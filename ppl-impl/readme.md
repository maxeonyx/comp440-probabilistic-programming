To run the programming language, use either `cargo run` (if you have installed Rust) or `thisppl` (if you are using the binary from the GitHub release. The program will provide help.

An example of running a program, is `./thisppl infer hw2_b_bayesian_linear_regression.ppl likelihood-weighting`. This runs inference using the default number of samples, and writes a data file to `./data/hw2_b_bayesian_linear_regression.json`.
